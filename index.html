                <p class="main-p">
                    Welcome to this tiny corner of the internet that you somehow stumbled upon.
                    I'm a happy Game Developer who spends more time debugging than actually finishing projects.
                    If you're reading this, it means I finally managed to write something other than an error log.
                </p>
                <p class="main-p">
                    I got into programming since… well, who knows?
                    Probably since I realized the real world is too boring
                    and full of rules that can't be altered with a single line of code.
                    So instead of trying to understand people, I decided to spend my time with code that—while often
                    broken—at least can be fixed without questioning its existence.
                </p>
                <p class="main-p">
                    Here, you’ll find some projects that, for some reason, I haven’t buried in the “old_projects”
                    folder, and maybe an occasional devlogs if I feel productive enough.
                    If you enjoy exploring absurd ideas, love games,
                    or just want to watch someone slowly lose their sanity over syntax errors,
                    we might get along just fine.
                </p>
                <p class="main-p">
                    Oh, and if life feels too easy and you need a new challenge, try reading my source code.
                    I guarantee it's more confusing than your own existence.<br><br>
                    Happy browsing. Don’t forget to bring a flashlight.
                </p>

            <section id="projects">
                <h2 class="section-header">PROJECT</h2>

                <p class="main-p">
                    Ah yes, my collection of projects—some alive, some half-baked, and many abandoned in the depths of
                    my GitHub repo like ancient relics of a civilization that tried but never quite made it.
                </p>
                <p class="main-p">
                    <ul class="main-ul">
                        <li><strong>One Fully Completed Game in Pygame</strong><br>
                            That’s right.
                            After countless hours of debugging, fighting with indentation errors,
                            and questioning my life choices,
                            one game actually made it to the finish line.
                            A miracle, really.
                            Most projects don’t make it past the “this is a cool idea”
                            phase before I get distracted by another “cooler” idea.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>My GitHub: The Digital Hoarder’s Paradise</strong><br>
                            My GitHub is basically a museum of unfinished potential.
                            There's everything from half-working game prototypes to projects that seemed like a good idea
                            at 3 AM but were clearly a mistake in daylight. Some repos are active,
                            some are just chilling there waiting for me to remember their existence.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Current Projects: The Eternal WIP Cycle</strong><br>
                            Right now, I’m juggling multiple projects,
                            most of which are in that “almost working but not quite” state.
                            If progress was measured in enthusiasm, I'd be a billionaire.
                            Unfortunately, it’s measured in actual working code, so here we are.
                        </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="main-p">
                    At this rate, I might finish another game before humanity colonizes Mars. Or not.<br>
                    Either way, check out my repos and witness the chaos unfold.

                <h2 class="section-header">DEVLOGS</h2>

                <p class="main-p">
                    Welcome to my devlogs, where I document my coding journey, questionable design choices,
                    and occasional existential crises.
                    Think of it as a diary, but instead of deep emotional reflections,
                    it’s mostly me screaming into the void about why my code refuses to work.
                </p>

                <p class="main-p">
                    <ul class="main-ul">
                        <li><strong>The Debugging Saga</strong><br>
                            Every devlog is basically a retelling of how I spent hours chasing a bug,
                            only to realize it was a missing semicolon.
                            Or how I rewrote an entire feature just to end up right where I started.
                            It’s like a suspense thriller, except the villain was always me from 5 hours ago.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Progress? Sure, Let’s Call It That</strong><br>
                            Some days, I feel like a genius.
                            Other days, I just stare at the screen,
                            wondering if I even understand what I wrote yesterday.
                            Progress is being made… in the same way a snail makes progress across a highway.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Lessons Learned (Or Ignored)</strong><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Never say, “I’ll just fix one more thing before sleeping.”
                                    That’s a trap.
                                    You can see that proof directly from my eyes.
                                </li>
                                <li>If your code works, but you don’t know why, don’t touch it.</li>
                                <li>Pygame, SFML, and LÖVE are great. Until they aren’t.</li>
                                <li>Writing a devlog makes me feel productive, even if my code is still on life support.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="main-p">
                    If you enjoy watching a developer slowly losing their grip on reality, stay tuned for more updates.
                    <br>
                    Or, you know, check back in six months when I finally remember to write another entry.
