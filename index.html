                <p class="main-p">
                    Welcome to this tiny corner of the internet that you somehow stumbled upon.
                    I'm<strong class="main-p" style="font-size:larger; color: #00248d">Samudra</strong>,
                    a happy-to-live Game Developer who spends more time
                    debugging than actually finishing projects.
                    If you're reading this, it means I finally managed to write something other than an error log.
                </p>
                <p class="main-p">
                    I got into programming since… well, who knows?
                    Probably since I realized the real world is too boring
                    and full of rules that can't be altered with a single line of code.
                    So instead of trying to understand people, I decided to spend my time with code that—while often
                    broken—at least can be fixed without questioning its existence.
                    I guess that's why I haven't gotten a girlfriend yet.
                </p>
                <p class="main-p">
                    I’m also a self-proclaimed expert in procrastination, a master of debugging, and a connoisseur of
                    questionable design choices.
                    If you need someone to spend hours fixing a bug that was caused by a
                    missing semicolon, I’m your guy.
                    If you need someone to make a game that’s 90% bugs and 10% playable, I’m also your guy.
                    If you need someone to make a game that’s 100% bugs and 0% playable, well, I’m
                    probably still your guy.
                </p>
                <p class="main-p">
                    Here, you’ll find some projects that, for some reason, I haven’t buried in the “old_projects”
                    folder, and maybe an occasional devlogs if I feel productive enough.
                    If you enjoy exploring absurd ideas, love games,
                    or just want to watch someone slowly lose their sanity over syntax errors,
                    we might get along just fine.
                </p>
                <p class="main-p">
                    Oh, and if life feels too easy and you need a new challenge, try reading my source code.
                    I guarantee it's more confusing than your own existence.<br><br>
                    Happy browsing. Don’t forget to bring a flashlight.

                <h2 class="section-header">EXPERIENCE</h2>

                <p class="main-p">
                    I’m somewhat of a big deal in the <a href="https://play.fancade.com/">Fancade</a> community.
                    Well, as big of a deal as you can be in a community that most people haven’t even heard of.
                    Since 2020, I’ve been making games there, crafting logic puzzles,
                    and watching as my sanity slowly erodes with each increasingly complex project.
                    But hey, at least in that small corner of the internet, people know my name.
                </p>
                <p class="main-p">
                    Fast-forward to college, where I finally decided to take programming seriously—because apparently,
                    making logic-based games without understanding actual programming was not the best long-term strategy.
                    Now in my second semester, I already threw myself into multiple projects
                    (as detailed in the <a href="#projects">Projects</a> section).
                    Some were completed, some are still WIP, and some… well, let’s just say they exist purely to haunt my GitHub.
                </p>
                <p class="main-p">
                    My strongest programming language is C++, though I wouldn’t dare call myself an expert.
                    I mostly use it for game development, because why write simple, clean programs when I can instead
                    torture myself with physics engines and rendering pipelines?
                    Of course, my greatest achievement in programming remains the day I successfully printed
                    "Hello, World!" in C—a language so old and powerful
                    that modern devs treat it with the same reverence as ancient forbidden texts.

                <p class="main-p">
                    Welcome to my devlogs, where I document my coding journey, questionable design choices,
                    and occasional existential crises.
                    Think of it as a diary, but instead of deep emotional reflections,
                    it’s mostly me screaming into the void about why my code refuses to work.
                </p>

                <p class="main-p">
                    <ul class="main-ul">
                        <li><strong>The Debugging Saga</strong><br>
                            Every devlog is basically a retelling of how I spent hours chasing a bug,
                            only to realize it was a missing semicolon.
                            Or how I rewrote an entire feature just to end up right where I started.
                            It’s like a suspense thriller, except the villain was always me from 5 hours ago.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Progress? Sure, Let’s Call It That</strong><br>
                            Some days, I feel like a genius.
                            Other days, I just stare at the screen,
                            wondering if I even understand what I wrote yesterday.
                            Progress is being made… in the same way a snail makes progress across a highway.

                                <li>Never say, “I’ll just fix one more thing before sleeping.”
                                    That’s a trap.
                                    You can see the proof directly from my eye bags.
                                </li>
                                <li>If your code works, but you don’t know why, don’t touch it.</li>

                                <li>Writing a devlog makes me feel productive, even if my code is still on life support.</li>

                    If you enjoy watching a developer slowly losing their grip on reality, stay tuned for more updates.
