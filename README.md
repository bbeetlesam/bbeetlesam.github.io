WELCOME to my personal website, free-hosted with GitHub Pages. 
Here, guess I'll put a list of my projects and my own portfolio (for God's sake, I'm really craving a job), 
and maybe showcasing some of my ongoing/completed projects. 

This is my first ever completed web project, so I really enjoy the swe-our and sour of the process
and very excited about what the result would look like, before someone realizing that nobody is actually
paying attention to this shit.

I feel like Web Dev is my second favorite after Game Dev, proven by how much I put my mind to this website solely.
But well, my mind is changing fast sometimes. Maybe I'd go to Machine Learning tomorrow, who knows.

## Languages and Frameworks

Currently, this website only uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so you can't expect too much from the page,
but I'll consider learning some CSS frameworks like Tailwind/Bootstrap in the future, if the 'future' even comes.
JS frameworks? No, I don't know which one I should pick, too many people on it.

Currently, too, I'm a toddler to this web-dev stuffs, so **advices** would be very much appreciated!

## Contents

Currently, there are no worth-to-look contents/features on this website (I am a worthless soul),
besides me non-sensing too much nonsense. But I'll add more stuff inside it, like an embedded projects showcase, 
or my own devlog articles as soon as I want (can). But maybe, it'll take a lifetime. Very worth it tbh.
