# UM, HI.

## Welcome!

Welcome to my personal website, free-hosted with GitHub Pages. Here, guess I'll put list of my projects and
my own portfolio (for God's sake, I'm really craving for a job), and maybe showcasing some of my
ongoing/completed projects.<br>
You can find this website's repository in [here](https://github.com/bbeetlesam/bbeetlesam.github.io/).

Currently, this website only uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so you can't expect too much from the page,
but I'll consider learning some CSS framework like Tailwind/Bootstrap in the future.

Currently too, I'm a toddler to this web-dev stuffs, so **advices** would be very much appreciated!

## More

Find some of my previous/current **projects** on:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/bbeetlesam/)
* [itch.io](https://bbeetlesam.itch.io/)

I also have [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jstsams/) and [Bluesky](https://bbeetlesam.bsky.social) account. Go for a look!<br>

### That's it. See you soon with the new updates!

P.S. If you feel generous and want to give more than an appreciate, you can buy me a tea (not quite a coffee fan)
through [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/bbeetlesam)!
