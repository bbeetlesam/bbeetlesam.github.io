# UM, HI.

## Welcome to my personal website!

This website is free-hosted by GitHub Pages,
and you can find the repository in [here](https://github.com/bbeetlesam/bbeetlesam.github.io/).<br>
Currently, this website only uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, so you can't expect too much from the page,
but I'll consider learning some CSS framework like Tailwind in the future.

## That's it. See you soon
