WELCOME to my personal website, free-hosted with GitHub Pages. 
Here, guess I'll put a list of my projects and my own portfolio ~~(for God's sake, I'm really craving a job)~~, 
and maybe showcasing some of my ongoing/completed projects. 

This is my first ever completed web project, so I really enjoy the **sweet and sour** of the process
and very excited about what the result would look like, before someone realizing that nobody is actually
paying attention to this shit.

I feel like Web Dev is my second favorite after Game Dev, proven by how much I put my mind to this website solely.
But well, my mind is changing fast sometimes. Maybe I'd go to Machine Learning tomorrow, who knows.

## Languages and Frameworks

Currently, this website only uses pure [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), 
[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), 
so you can't expect too much from the page,
but I'll consider learning some CSS frameworks like Tailwind/Bootstrap in the future, if the 'future' even comes.<br>
JS frameworks? No, I don't know which one I should pick, too many people on it.

Currently, too, I'm a toddler to this web-dev stuffs, so **advices** would be very much appreciated!

## Tools

- [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/) - Host this static website (HTML-CSS-JS).
- [**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/) - Use a bunch of icon sets (mostly on footer).
- [My lovely white ADVAN Workplus laptop]() with an Ilkom sticker and a bunch of scratches - For everything.

## Contents

Currently, there are no worth-to-look contents/features on this website (even myself),
except me non-sensing too much nonsense. But I'll add more stuff inside it, like an embedded projects showcase, 
or my own devlog articles as soon as I want (can).<br>
But, it might take a lifetime.

Very worth it for all the sleep I **missed**, the eye bags I **earned**, the insomnia I **embraced**, 
the aching back I **endured**, and the countless, precious hours of my life I'll **never** get back.

**Very worth it.**
