# ![logo][] UM, HI.

Welcome to my personal website, free-hosted with GitHub Pages. Here, guess I'll put list of my projects and
my own portfolio (for God's sake, I'm really craving for a job), and maybe showcasing some of my
ongoing/completed projects.<br>
You can find this website's repository in [here](https://github.com/bbeetlesam/bbeetlesam.github.io/).

## Languages and Frameworks

Currently, this website only uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so you can't expect too much from the page,
but I'll consider learning some CSS framework like Tailwind/Bootstrap in the future.

Currently too, I'm a toddler to this web-dev stuffs, so **advices** would be very much appreciated!

## Contents

Currently, there is no worth-to-look contents/feature in this website. But, I'll add more features as soon as I can!
